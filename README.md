CHIP8-Emu
=========

A CHIP8 emulator written in C and SDL.

##Key Bindings
The key bindings are:

    1 2 3 4
    q w e r
    a s d f
    z x c v

##Compiling
The only dependency is the SDL2 library.

I compiled this project using MSVC 2013 but it may, however, work under other compilers.

For now it only works with Windows, though a linux port is planned.
